For ages I've been looking for a working [SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SVG) animator but open source solutions never made the cut until, finally, I found something that mostly works.

[This guide has everything that I was missing](https://theartsquirrel.com/3908/svg-based-motion-graphics-software/).

I already knew about [Glaxnimate](https://glaxnimate.mattbas.org/) but importing SVGs made in [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) does not work very well, plus you need a third mouse button to pan.

I gave [Enve](https://maurycyliebner.github.io/dow/index)'s *AppImage* a shot but it didn't run:
```
$./enve-d919d4d-9_25_22-x86_64.AppImage 
enve: /tmp/.mount_enve-do3sHjs/usr/lib/libselinux.so.1: no version information available (required by /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgio-2.0.so.0)
enve: /tmp/.mount_enve-do3sHjs/usr/lib/libselinux.so.1: no version information available (required by /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmount.so.1)
enve: symbol lookup error: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgio-2.0.so.0: undefined symbol: g_module_open_full
```
*AppImages* should come with the dependencies. Even if it's bigger than 150mb.

Thankfully there's a fork of the former that does work: [Friction Motion Graphics](https://friction.graphics/)!

~~Finally I can animate *SVGs*. Sadly it can't export to video so it's still dependant on [Glaxnimate](https://glaxnimate.mattbas.org/).~~

To export to video you need to Render and pick a few optionss. I made [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0X2bSSb6TVw) showing everything that you need to do.
