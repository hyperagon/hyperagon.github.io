I wanted to play a game made in [Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) (an *.SWF* file) and looked for options,
[Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) has a [nice demo](https://ruffle.rs/demo/) that lets you pick the file to try but what if you just want to run it locally? The FAQ says to download the latest and gives you a one-line script which is not enough.

What other options are there? Well there is [AwayFL](https://awayfl.org/) which has an outstanding example (in the *example* folder after you extract the *.ZIP*):
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>AwayFL Embed Example</title>
    <script src="../dist/embed.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id = 'container'>

    </div>

    <script>
        window.AWAY_EMBED_CFG = {}
        swfObject.embedSWF('Embedded.swf', 'container', 550, 400);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
Now we're getting somewhere, that's a complete *.HTML* plus an *.SWF* to boot, sadly it does not seem to work so back to Rufus.

- Download [AwayFL](https://github.com/awayfl/awayfl-embed/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and copy its *example/Embedded.swf* and *example/index.html* files.
- Download [Ruffle (in this case 2025-05-09)](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/releases/download/nightly-2025-05-09/ruffle-nightly-2025_05_09-web-selfhosted.zip) and extract the *.ZIP* and paste our *index.html* and *embed.swf* in that folder.
- Edit *index.html* to:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Ruffle Embed in AwayFL Example</title>
    <script src="embed.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id = 'container'>

    </div>

    <script>
        window.RufflePlayer = window.RufflePlayer || {};

        window.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
            let ruffle = window.RufflePlayer.newest();
            let player = ruffle.createPlayer();
            let container = document.getElementById("container");
            container.appendChild(player);
            player.ruffle().load("Embedded.swf");
        });
    </script>
    <script src="ruffle.js"></script>
</body>
```

It will give you an error when you open the *index.html* in your browser, you need to serve it which is easily done if you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) with `python -m http.server`, it will host the current directory at **http://0.0.0.0:8000/** and if you open it, you should now see [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/) loading up then a Play button and finally a circle and a square.

## I later made a video on this, [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glrPhtk8_-c).

PS: If you'd rather you can also use [AwayFL](https://awayfl.org/) directly by running `python -m http.server` on its folder and opening **http://0.0.0.0:8000/example** on a browser.
