Added my [YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/@hyperag-on) to this [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) Homepage. I switched from *.TOML* to *.YAML* long ago so keep that in mind.
All that I had to do was add this to `config.yaml`:
```
[[params.socialIcons]]
name = "youtube"
url = "https://www.youtube.com/@hyperag-on"
```

PS: I use the [PaperMod Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/).
