Was looking for new Linux Games and cheats and found [AstroMenace by Viewizard](https://viewizard.com/) but, of course, I wanted to cheat on it and found [a modification by Rich√®l Bilderbeek](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/astro_menace_cheat).

Sadly it didn't work as it was missing two prerequisits which I found through [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [CMake](https://cmake.org/)'s messages and some searching.

```
./build_astro_menace.sh: line 18: cmake: command not found
,,,
Could NOT find Freetype (missing: FREETYPE_LIBRARY FREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIRS)
Call Stack (most recent call first):
```

I'm happy that it was this eassy to solve.
