Was looking for new Linux Games and cheats and found [AstroMenace by Viewizard](https://viewizard.com/) but, of course, I wanted to cheat on it and found [a modification by Rich√®l Bilderbeek](https://github.com/richelbilderbeek/astro_menace_cheat).

Sadly it didn't work as it was missing two packages which I found through [CMake](https://cmake.org/)'s messages and some searching:

```
./build_astro_menace.sh: line 18: cmake: command not found
...
Could NOT find Freetype (missing: FREETYPE_LIBRARY FREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIRS)
Call Stack (most recent call first):
```

Install those new requirements and it'll work:
```
sudo apt-get install cmake libfreetype6-dev
```

I'm happy that it was this easy to solve. Enjoy the game.

PS: I already submited a pull request so most won't even notice.
