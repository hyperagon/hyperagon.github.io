So I had a little issue with [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/) where the contents of my Home folder were littered accross my Desktop.
Thankfully the solution was easy to find, [here](forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=222560) once identified.

Basically just `vim .config`, pick *user_dirs.dirs* and press **I**, write *Deskop* after **XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/** then  *Escape* + *:wq* to save.
