So I had a little issue with [Parrot OS](https://www.parrotsec.org/) where the contents of my Home folder were littered accross my Desktop.
Thankfully the [solution was easy to find after identified](https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?t=222560).

Basically just `vim .config`, pick `user_dirs.dirs` and press **I**, write `Deskop` after `XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/"` then  *Escape* + **:wq** to save.
