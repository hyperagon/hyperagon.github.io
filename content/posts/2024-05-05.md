Some Linux distributions don't come with **python**. Starting with [a guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZU45QsAcl0).

```
#!/bin/bash
DIR="Python-3.12.3"
if [ ! -d "$DIR" ]; then
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libbz2-dev
  wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.3/Python-3.12.3.tgz
  sudo tar -xf Python-3.12.3.tgz
fi;
cd "$DIR"
sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make altinstall
echo "alias python=python3.12" >> ~/.bashrc
alias python=python3.12
```

You can now run `python` as well as `pip`.

Note:
- I didn't include `libsqlite3-dev` as I couldn't find that package but it is optional
- Running it multiple times will keep adding to the bashrc file
