So I re-installed the OS since I couldn't remember the password, having copied a lot earlier in case this would happen and I forgot to copy some files. Oh well, Fam's stuff is optional.
One annoyance that I encountered was this kind of stuff when using `apt-get update`:
```
W: Target Packages (main/binary-amd64/Packages) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list:1 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list:19
...
```
 
This was due to the fact that I had both `/etc/apt/sources.list` and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list` with different sources, so much for my [previous guide](/podts/2024-22-09/). Anyway I [found a helpful explanation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22968952/debian-sources-list-d-versus-sources-list).
