So I re-installed the OS since I couldn't remember the password, having copied a lot earlier for when this would happen and I forgot to copy some files, oh well, Fam's stuff is optional.

One annoyance that I encountered was this kind of stuff:
```
W: Target Packages (main/binary-amd64/Packages) is configured multiple times in /etc/apt/sources.list:1 and /etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list:19
...
```
 
This little message was due to the fact that I had both `/etc/apt/sources.list` and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list` with different sorces, so much for my [previous guide](/2024-22-09/).
