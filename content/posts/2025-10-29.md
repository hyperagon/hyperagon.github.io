I saw a new prompt ([here](https://youtu.be/xt6_zIKeX6A?t=436)) rather interesting since it's a relatively simple concept which most **LLMs** don't seem to be trained on (yet).

It involves bees building a Beehive. Quite pretty.
Some *LLMs* decided to add a source of honey but off-screen works fine.

Here's my prompt:
```
Make a visual simulation of a beehive construction, start with a single cell and show hexagonal cells forming, worker bee trails, and honey storage. Include sliders for colony size and bee speed. Put everything in a standalone HTML file. Each cell can only be filled by 1% at a time and must be fully filled at 100% before bees make new ones. if cells get filled bees need to re-pick the target cell whether they have honey or not.
```
