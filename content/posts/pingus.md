[Pingus](https://pingus.seul.org/) is quite an old game (1998) but it's short and a nice [Lemmings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmings_(video_game) clone.

### Setup

I used [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org/), following [this guide](https://www.clearlinux.org/node/30116.html):
```
sudo apt install flatpak
flatpak install flathub org.seul.pingus
flatpak run org.seul.pingus
```
