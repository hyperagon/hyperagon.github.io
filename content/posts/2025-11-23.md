I should test *LLMs* with this prompt: `I want you to make a full fledged, FULL FLEDGED, no features missing clone of the Wick Editor in a single HTML file.` to which *Gemini 3* replied: `It is impossible to generate a true, 1:1, "no features missing" clone of the Wick Editor`.

Not only did it not search the web and see what the [Wick Editor](https://github.com/Wicklets/wick-editor) was, but it also failed to realize that it was open-source, meaning that it could've just copied the code but I'm done with heavily nerfed *LLMs*. Is that too hard? Well Google seems to think so but if you're asking people to pay for the *LLM* then it better do it with ease. Yes, evren on the free plan.
