So [**Elon Musk** tweeted](https://youtu.be/GvivnEHrtxA?t=64) that due to **Apple** using **OpenAI** (not by default but whatever) that Apple devices would be forbidden at work. It's not any better than **Microsoft**...

In other news **Apple** surpassed **Microasoft** as the worls most valuable company (highest stock price), this AI thing really makes everything more expensive. **Nvidia** itself remains the third.
