I made and tried a new prompt for an improved [Hexano](https://hyperagon.github.io/projects/hexano15/).


Here's my prompt:
```
Make a Hexagon-tiled synthesizer named Hexano.
Keep it all in a single HTML file with the style and script inline.
Add a menu bar with:
    - A Record button that is an SVG circle and filled with red when active, it should save the played music to a WAV file.
    - A Play/Stop button that replays the recreates the recorded sound or stops
    - Five squares for Wave type with a border around the selected one, each a SVG with a path showing the type of Wave (Sine, Cosine, Square, Saw-tooth and Triangle)
    - A volume slider
    - A full-screen on/off SVG button
    
    By default the melody pre-recorded is C4-E4-G4-E4-C4-E4-G4-E4,C4+E4+G4

Then an SVG file (the hexboard) with all of the Hexagons in the following arrangement:
  C2|C#2|D2|D#2|E2|F2|F#2|G2|G#2|A2|A#2|B2
C3|C#3|D3|D#3|E3|F3|F#3|G3|G#3|A3|A#3|B3
  C4|C#4|D4|D#4|E4|F4|F#4|G4|G#4|A4|A#4|B4
C5|C#5|D5|D#5|E5|F5|F#5|G5|G#5|A5|A#5|B5
  C5|C#5|D5|D#5|E5|F5|F#5|G5|G#5|A5|A#5|B5
C7|C#7|D7|D#7|E7|F7|F#7|G7|G#7|A7|A#7|B7
  C8|C#8|D8|D#8|E8|F8|F#8|G8|G#8|A8|A#8|B8

Pressing any will play that sound, you need to figure out their respective frequencies. In fact, pressing any of these and the play button is supposed to play sound so make sure that there's always an audio context and oscillators ready. Should the mouse move while playing the Hexagon under it will play and the previous one stops. This should also support multiple touches.

Pressing the following with play these note:
a : C4
s : D4
d : E4
f : F4
g : G4
h : A4
j : B4
w : C#4
e : D#4
r : F#4
t : G#4
y : A#4

The hexboard should be scaled to touch the left and right edges of the window and rotate if the width is smaller than the height, in which case it is scaled to touch the menu and the bottom of the page. The menu does not rotate.
