I simplified my requirements and the results were great, no more drawing a complex path just to see it being simplified into a single line.
- Simplify the paths to 2 **Anchors** per Line or Curve with **Control Nodes** as long as required
- Keep lumps, just make new segments
- *Zoom* should not make **Anchors** and **Control Nodes** huge. keep them at a constant size
- Allow for detailed drawing while *Zoomed-in*

Pressing **+** doesn't have a limit so check the actual value by pressing the *Magnifying Glass button*.

By the way, this edited these functions so you can play around with them:
- simplifyPath
- ramerDouglasPeucker
- pointLineDistance
- calculateControlPoints
- drawMove
