This was worrying, an **LLM** used an `event.shiftKey` to check if the *Shift* key was pressed as per the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/shiftKey)
but it didn't work? In fact, after a `console.log(event)`, it was apparent that no such variable existed.

## Problem
```
                switch(event.key) {
                    case 'z':
                        event.preventDefault();
                        if (event.shiftKey) {
                            redo(); // Ctrl+Shift+Z for Redo
                        } else {
                            undo(); // Ctrl+Z for Undo
                        }
                        break;
                    ...
```

Wait so the *documentation* was wrong? Probably not, for all we know the *Browser* may be at fault here.

## Solution
```
                switch(event.key) {
                    case 'z':
                        event.preventDefault();
                        if (event.shiftKey) {
                            redo(); // Ctrl+Shift+Z for Redo
                        } else {
                            undo(); // Ctrl+Z for Undo
                        }
                        break;
                    case 'Z':
                        event.preventDefault();
                        redo(); // Ctrl+Shift+Z for Redo
                        break;
                    ...
```

The solution is easy, even obvious, but add this to the pile of things that *LLMs* [will fail at](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeicqHJBKAk).
