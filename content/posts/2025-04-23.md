So I asked **Mistral** to make a script, the objective was to make a transcript for a video, based on the **mp4** file.
It proceweded to make one, with a ton of libraries to handle everything, one to get the audio. one to transcribe it, etc.

This meant that the scope was too wide so I dialed it back enough to simpliffy the problem.
First I split the vocals into an **mp3** myself and asked it to only make a template **srt** from an **mp3**.

This script still equires one library, [PyDub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub).
I then asked it to add progress information but it failed, only showing that in the end.

What do you think? It's a handy script if you are "gpu poor".
