I've been vibe-coding a little tool and the *LLM* keeps confirming that I'm absolutely right, even if I'm not. And proceeds to screw up again...

I forsee much hardship in the future with *LLM*s being heavily relied upon yet being so eager to make any changes without reflecting.
ªThinking* doesn't help in this aspect...
