So I looked into [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/) and was very close to setting up a page there,
but when I read their [terms-of-service](https://more.ko-fi.com/terms), where they say that they are not going to handle anything money-wise yet may cbarge fees.

```
...
Ko-fi is not a party to any transactions conducted via the Site and bears no responsibility for your tax obligations, nor any liability for associated penalties or losses.
...
You may be required to pay fees, on a subscription basis, for using the Site as a Creator.
...
```

So yeah, no thanks. No worries for you yet you take "+ 5% service fee" which does not sound as free az I intially thought.
