So I saw a Youtuber worried about [COPPA 2.0](https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/coppa-2-children-teens-online-privacy-protection-act/). Yeah, I wonder how they'll enforce it this time and a *Erase button* if **you may** be under 17, sound like it'll just make the *Internet* worse again but I'd be happy to be wrong.

Amyway this website doesn't collect anything unless [Github](https://github.com/) messes with its platform so no worries here.

R.I.P. [Cocomelon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_qEtNJpmAk). that's what kids watch right?
