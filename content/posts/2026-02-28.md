So it's been a month and I added a melody generator to [Hexano (7.1)](https://hyperagon.github.io/projects/hexano/), now using a simpler link (/hexano),
and greatly improved [Slidus (9.3)](https://hyperagon.github.io/projects/slidus/), finally getting what I wanted, an easy way to make vector graphics.

I learned that this prompt does not work:
```
Do not add any features, styles, or logic that I did not explicitly ask for.
Make no other changes to the code. Do not improve, refactor, or optimize anything else.
Do not add any default UI behaviors (like hover effects or animations) unless I specifically request them.
```

Anyway, you shouldn't give the full code and ask for it to change the whole thing as it may change the wrong things.
This is what you should do instead. Of course you will have to update the code yourself:
```
Give me the updated code segments.
```

Oh and keep testing, my [Draw videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR8RpY-JL-8&list=PLTLdzr99RdwdfcUsNVlon4dix7Zjsp_LW) served as live tests and helped me see what was missing or wasn't working right.

Want to see the process? I used a plain text file:
```
- Slidus: Line width shouldn't change on zoom (it is constant, naturally it looks bigger on zoom-in) so why does it increase on zoom-out?
- Slidus: Rotation should work on all selected paths together, the pivot is the is the center
- Slidus: H flips the selection Horizontally and V flips it vertically.
- Slidus: If I hold Ctrl while rotating with the Circled-X it should snap to multiples of 5 degrees.
- Slidus: Add black outline to Cross
- Slidus: Ctrl+Arrow Key(s) Pans
- Slidus: Make a button to trace a color on click, making a full path encompassing it. It should be right of Close/Merge
- Slidus: Snap during drawing.
- Hexano: Ask Gemini to improve the Melody Generator
- Hexano: Add a melody generator
- Slidus: Ctrl+Scroll up or down zooms the page, this ruins the reference drawing relationship either stop it or have it zoom normaly
- Slidus: If I draw a small line it gets a ton of Anchors, what the heck? It should only have 2.
- Slidus: Add a rotation buttom right of Move over a selected Path, this is a cross that has a ring around it (a circle with a hole), the ring moves along the cross when the cross is dragged, snapping to the center (marked with a small cross) or Anchors in the selected Pafh
- Ctrl+Click = Double-Click, in other words remove the Anchor
- Slidus: Duplicate selected shapes if I press D or Ctrl+D
- Slidus: If I draw a single line, all points are on it, if I draw a path that just happens to have the start closto its end I want the whole thing. Make it happen.
- Slidus: Look at this output: <svg>...</svg> do you realize how annoying it was to do it line by line because Slidus kept turning large shapes into small lines? Make Slidus much betterat handling my drawings, oh and I expect smaller Anchors and Control Nodes when I zoom in. That's why I zoom in in the first place. micro-edits. (now it's not simplifying anything...)
- Slidus: The optimization is turning squares into circles, please make sure that it retains several sharp turns like when I draw something pointy like a star or rectangle.
- Slidus: Add a small button (color picker icon) between Fill and Stroke color that shows a black border around them (fill and stroke color) and selects one by moving the mouse over or clicking it (border becomes white when selected) then change that color to whatever pixel is clicked in either path or reference then removes the bordes
- Slidus: When I hold Ctrl the handle shouldn't change the handles line length, also it should snap to multiples of 15 degrees, like 45 or 270.
- Slidus: Add a small button (magnet) between Fill and Stroke opacity slides that toggles Snap. It needs to be visually pressed when on.
- Slidus: Control Nodes (red circles) shouldn't start over Anchors (White Squares). Draw Anchors over Control Nodes.
- Slidus: Fix mouse-up not finishing a control point drag (it locks).
- Slidus: I can merge any number of selected paths, just merge them 1 by 1 then 2 by 1 so A+B+C = A+B then (A+B)+C
- Slidus: Disregard clicks on Draw mode (it should not select or change modes).
- Slidus: If I move a node/anchor it should move the red control points along with it.
- Slidus: When I close a shape the ends should get a control point for the line connecting them and I can drag that line normally.
- Slidus: Move the instructions in the status information to a separate Help panel it appears when pressing "?" next to the x to close the toolbox.
- Slidus: Only pan when I press the right mouse button or use 2 fingers.
- Slidus: Pan and Zoom also apply to the Reference
- Slidus: Replace "Clear All" with "Delete" when there are paths selected.
- Slidus: "Close / Merge" button should be in the Actions section before Import/Zoom/Export
- Slidus: Holding Ctrl makes the angle of the held control point a multiple of 20º allowing for more control.
- Slidus: Add a button between Clear Ref. and Clear All with a hamburger. Pressing it shows a few options to reorder the path, Top, Pull, Push and Bottom.
- Slidus: Add a button between Import and Export with a magnifying glass. Pressing it shows a slider and moving it zooms in or out centered on the middle of the canvas.
- Slidus: Zoom in/out with +/- or i/o centered on the mouse unless , 0 resets and centers both canvas
- Slidus: Add a button to the left of Export SVG to "Import" it works the same as dropping an SVG
- Slidus: Load SVG on drop (do not replace existing)
- Slidus: Add a button to the left of Clear All that Clears the Reference (same as pressing backspace)
- Slidus: Clear background on backspace
- Slidus: Connect edges of paths and paths with the Close Shape / Merge button
- Stylus: Snap anchors to other anchors or paths
- Video: LLMs try to make Slidus
- Slidus : Sliding Stylus
```
