So it's been a month, I added a melody generator to [Hexano (7.1)](https://hyperagon.github.io/projects/hexano/), now used a constant link (/hexano)
and greatly improved [Slidus (9,3)](https://hyperagon.github.io/projects/slidus/), finally getting what I wanted, a productive way to make vector graphics.

I learned that this prompt does not work:
```
Do not add any features, styles, or logic that I did not explicitly ask for.
Make no other changes to the code. Do not improve, refactor, or optimize anything else.
Do not add any default UI behaviors (like hover effects or animations) unless I specifically request them.
```

You shoulfn't ever give the full code and ask for it to change the thole thing so...
Anyway, this one works but you have to update the code yourself:
```
Give me the updated code segments.
```

Oh and keep testing, my [Draw videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LR8RpY-JL-8&list=PLTLdzr99RdwdfcUsNVlon4dix7Zjsp_LW) served as live tests and helped me see what was missing or wasn't working right.

Of course this won't work as well if the Application makes audio.
