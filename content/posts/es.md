[Endless Sky]((https://endless-sky.github.io/)) is another [open-source](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) game, made with [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++).

Similar to [NAEV](https://naev.org/) it was inspired by the **Escape Velocity** gane.
I looked to [cheat and found a discussion,](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/0/154645427521143152/) then I digged around and made my own list to avoid needing [plugins](https://endless-sky.github.io/plugins.html) / [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/).

## Add Cloaking

Either add `cloak 0.04` to your ship's attributes or a `Cloking Device` to its outfits.

Press **C** to cloak, note that you can't fire weapons or hail planets while cloaked.

## Add Outifts (they all take mass but outfits space will go negative and still work)

```
	outfits
	...
	"Cargo Expansion" 99
	"Fuel Pod" 99
  ```

While you could just edit the ships *fuel* and *cargo space* not all parameters work.

### Huge Thrusters (but also fastest)

```
	outfits
	...
	"Tyrant Plasma Steering"
	"Tyrant Plasma Thruster"
```

### Add Quarg equipment (Alien technology is mostly better)

```
	outfits
	...
	"Antimatter Core"
	"Intrusion Countermeasures" 20
	"Jump Drive"
	"Medium Graviton Steering"
	"Medium Graviton Thruster"
