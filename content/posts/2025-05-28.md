So I wanted some voice conversion to make *Fam*'s speech less robotic yet my findings resulted in:
- [PyWorld](https://pypi.org/project/pyworld/): Male+Female voices = Young Boy
- [SoftVC VITS Singing Voice Conversion](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc): Outdated
- [Amphion](https://github.com/open-mmlab/Amphion): This mixes a lot into one package, making it huge (14.6 Gb just for Vevo)!

Which leans a lot into using *Machine Learning* and thus, requiring expensive *GPU*s or you're stuck with something basic like PyWorld.
