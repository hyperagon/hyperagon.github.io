[HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) reports no errors yet doesn't work now?

This post shows up fast yet the new Hexano 6.8 does not.

Ah it would seem that the *YAML* had an issue, likely due to when I tried to avoid minification but this gives *NO ERROR* and does not show the new page, posts work though to add to the confusion.

Use a [TOML](https://codebeautify.org/toml-validator) and/or [YAML](https://www.yamllint.com/) validator.
