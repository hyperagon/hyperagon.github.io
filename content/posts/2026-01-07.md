[HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) reports no errors yet doesn't work now?

This post shows up fast yet the new Hexano 6.8 does not.

Ah it would seem that the *YAML* had an issue, likely due to when I tried to avoid minification but this gives *NO ERROR* and does not show the new page, posts work though to add to the confusion.

Use a [TOML](https://codebeautify.org/toml-validator) and/or [YAML](https://www.yamllint.com/) validator.

This is working fine, I wonder what's wrong with the layout.

I was able to get it working by putting v4 in it yet the Classes trip it up. Back to the drawing board.

Let's see if this works.
```
Do not use Classes for this, use Objects for the Instruments.
```

Ok I got it working by forcing the AudioContext to regenerate with:
```
  // FIX: Ensure mainGainNode is initialized
  if (!mainGainNode || mainGainNode.context !== audioContext) {
      if (!audioContext) return; 
      mainGainNode = audioContext.createGain();
      mainGainNode.gain.value = volumeSlider ? volumeSlider.value : 0.5;
      mainGainNode.connect(audioContext.destination);
  }
```
This along with converting Classes to Objects, what a forceful solution.

Anyway you can also download it and use locally [from here](https://github.com/hyperagon/Hexano/releases).

I have updtated *Hexano 4* to have the graphical improvements of *Hexano 6* and tried to update it but I'm not hopeful.

Also fixed many issues, apparently "use strict"; is used for minification.
