Found this [little link](https://brrr.money/), it's always nice to listen to [GAS GAS GAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljwUlY9WW1I) and it goes quite well with the [meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/hn3qnw/whats_up_with_the_memes_titled_thing_go_brr/).

One day, AI will go brrr too.

But I like [Brr Patapim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C1g028A0DA) more.
