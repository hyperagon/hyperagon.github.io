Found the [Primeagen talking about a post on how *Coding should be a Vibe*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfT6sMkj6Ow).

It makes sense, programming should be fun but sometimes things just don't work and you won't know why unless you look at the code yourself.

My vibe-coded [Pomodoro](https://github.com/hyperagon/pomodoro) is another example where LLMs had trouble with going from v1 to v2. I added debugging constants to help me test it faster.
