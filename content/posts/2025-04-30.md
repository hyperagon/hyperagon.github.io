So I asked **Qwen** to make a script, the objective was to make a transcript for a video, based on an **mp3** file.
It proceeded to make one and I was careful to tell it to only use a limited set of libraries.

This script still required three libraries, `pydub`, `speech_recognition` and `tqdm`, the last one being only for the fancy progress-bar. You can find it [here](https://github.com/hyperagon/mp3_to_sbv).

But. funily enough, it stumbled on this part of the code (this is an example of the problem):
```
import sys
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

size = 10    

# Initialize the progress bar for processing segments
progress_bar = tqdm(total=size, desc="Processing segments", unit="segment", ncols=100, file=sys.stdout)

for i in range(size):
    time.sleep(0.5)

    # Update the progress bar
    progress_bar.update(1)

# Close the progress bar
progress_bar.close()
```
Which shows several progress bars, one per line, instead of a single one like it suggested this to see if *TQDM* was working:
```
import sys
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

for i in tqdm(range(10), desc="Test Progress Bar", file=sys.stdout):
    time.sleep(0.5)
    # sys.stdout.flush()
```

Which reinforces my belief that by itself, AI is fast but not very smart.

As [ColdFusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqVhUX4Vel8&t=1360s) warned, you should review the transcript that it produced as it makes mistakes.
