I asked **Qwen** to make a script that makes a transcript for a video, based on an **mp3** file.
I was careful to tell it to only use a limited set of libraries but this script still required three libraries, `pydub`, `speech_recognition` and `tqdm`, the last one being only for the fancy progress-bar. You can find it [here](https://github.com/hyperagon/mp3_to_sbv).

Funily enough it stumbled on this part of the code (this is an example of the problem):
```
import sys
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

size = 10

with tqdm(total=size, desc="Progress", unit="segment", ncols=100, file=sys.stdout) as progress:
    for _ in range(size):
        time.sleep(0.5)
        progress.update(1)
```
Which shows several progress bars. One per line, instead of a single one like it suggested to see if *TQDM* was working:
```
import sys
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

for i in tqdm(range(10), desc="Test Progress Bar", file=sys.stdout):
    time.sleep(0.5)
    # sys.stdout.flush()
```

Which reinforces my belief that, by themselves, AIs/LLMs are fast but not very smart.

As [ColdFusion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqVhUX4Vel8&t=1360s) warned, you should review the transcript that it produced as it makes mistakes.

### I later made a video on this, [watch it here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSo-LW6ubjw).

Prompt, in case you're wondering:

```
Modify and Remove from the following script to only show one progress bar. Only output the corrected code.

import sys
from tqdm import tqdm
import time

size = 3

with tqdm(total=size, desc="Progress", unit="segment", ncols=100, file=sys.stdout) as progress:
    for _ in range(size):
        time.sleep(0.5)
        progress.update(1)
```

PS: I updated the example to make it easier to copy+paste.
