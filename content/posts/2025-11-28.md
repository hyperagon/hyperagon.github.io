Dear Github, it was nice using you but now you want to force [2 Factor Authenticarion](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/about-mandatory-two-factor-authentication)?

Seems like my only option is to [use one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_OTP_applications).
