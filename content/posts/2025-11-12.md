I made and tried a new prompt, a relatively simple concept which most **LLMs** don't seem to be trained on (yet).
Why do most **LLMs** fail to understand hexagonal tiling?

Here's my prompt:
```
Make a hexagon-tiled piano, with each tile representing a note.
Build a single HTML page with everything inline.
There should be a bar on top that allows one to Record (circle that fills red when active) that saves a WAV with all the notes played if clicked after active, one to play to replay (show the keys pressed) or stop the previous melody, a wave style dropdown, a volume slider and a fullscreen svg button.
The notes are colored when pressed and pale colored otherwise.

Keyboard should work too.
```
