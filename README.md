Hello, I am **Hyperagon** and here are some facts about me:

- I am interested in [*Machine Learnind*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [*Video Games*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_games),
- I occasionally sketch on my Android smartphone,
- I love and prefer to use open source ([Linux](https://www.linux.org/)),
- I speak English rather well but it is [very American, not Bri-ish](https://www.speakmoreclearly.com/english-pronunciation-tips/the-difference-between-a-british-and-american-accent/),
- I was previously known as [Vimino](https://vimino.gitlab.io/) but don't want to be confused with the [product](https://www.amazon.in/Shrimps-Vitamin-Complex-Billion-Bacteria/dp/B0963691WP).
